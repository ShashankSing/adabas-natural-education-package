### Check the video tutorials
 * Video file attached with this github page

#### To tryout yourself 
 * Download the Virtual machine image file from the TECHcommunity website (~~URL~~)
 * Run the 'Adabas and Natural' cheatsheets from Help menu
 * 3 scenarios discussed in understanding of the Natural programming language
 
    - Hello World
      * Description : One of the many ways you can print your text/results on the console is through the usage of the WRITE "string" statements
    - Conditional constructs
      * Decription : The DECIDE ON statement is used to specify multiple actions to be performed depending on the value (or values) contained in a variable. Here, the FIRST keyword indicates that only the first value is to be processed with the NUMVALUE variable being initialised to 10. And therefore, based on the value contained in the NUMVALUE, an appropriate message is to be printed on the console, which is achieved through the usage of the DISPLAY statement here.
        
    - Basic Array manipulation
